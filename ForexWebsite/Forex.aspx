                            Traveler's cheque is a medium of exchange that can be used in place of hard currency. Traveler's cheques are often used by individuals traveling on vacation to foreign countries. Traveler's cheques can be denominated in one of a number of major world currencies and are preprinted, fixed-amount cheque designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of having paid the issuer for that privilege. They were generally used by people on vacation instead of cash, as many businesses used to accept traveler's cheques as currency. Merchants and other parties would accept them as if they were currency because, as long as the original signature (which the buyer is supposed to place on the cheque in ink as soon as they receive the cheque) and the signature made at the time the cheque is used is the same, the traveler's cheque issuer will unconditionally guarantee payment of the face amount even if the cheque is fraudulently issued, was stolen or lost. In short, a traveler's cheque can never 'bounce' unless the issuer goes bankrupt and out of business. If a traveler's cheque were lost or stolen, it could be replaced by the issuing financial institution. Their use has been in decline since as alternatives, such as credit cards, debit cards, and automated teller machines became more widely available and were easier and more convenient for travelers. Travelers cheques are no longer widely accepted and cannot easily be cashed, even at the banks that issue the cheques. Other factors that have led to a decline in traveler's cheques include the fees charged by the issuer and agent as well as the less favourable foreign exchange rate commonly used on traveler's cheques, especially compared to those on credit card transactions. Capital Forex Services help to get the card from authorized banks at an attractive rate. Traveler’s cheque amount shall form part of Liberalized Remittance Scheme and can be availed with the same set of documentation requirement. Capital Forex Services provide door delivery at no additional cost.
